# VisionCount- Real-time Human Detection & Counting

In this python project, we are going to build the Human Detection and Counting System through Webcam or you can give your own video or images. This is an intermediate level deep learning project on computer vision, which will help you to master the concepts and make you an expert in the field of Data Science. Let’s build an exciting project.

Human Detection with Computer Vision

Histogram of Oriented Gradient Descriptor
HOG is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection. This is one of the most popular techniques for object detection, to our fortune, OpenCV has already been implemented in an efficient way to combine the HOG Descriptor algorithm with Support Vector Machine or SVM.



Project Output


Now, after running the human detection python project with multiple images and video, we will get:

Summary


In this deep learning project, we have learned how to create a people counter using HOG and OpenCV to generate an efficient people counter. We developed the project where you can supply the input as: video, image, or even live camera. This is an intermediate level project, which will surely help you in mastering python and deep learning libraries.
