# VisionCount
In this python project, we are going to build the Human Detection and Counting System through Webcam or you can give your own video or images. This is an intermediate level deep learning project on computer vision, which will help you to master the concepts and make you an expert in the field of Data Science. Let’s build an exciting project.

Human Detection with Computer Vision
Project Prerequisites
The project in Python requires you to have basic knowledge of python programming and the OpenCV library. We will be needing following libraries:

OpenCV: A strong library used for machine learning
Imutils: To Image Processing
Numpy: Used for Scientific Computing. Image is stored in a numpy array.
Argparse: Used to give input in command line.
To install the required library, run the following code in your terminal.

pip install opencv-python
pip install imutils
pip install numpy
